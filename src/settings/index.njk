  <h2>
    Manage Data
  </h2>
  <p>
    If you aren't subscribed, your data is stored on your device. To sync your
    data between devices, you can export your data from one device to a file,
    then upload it to another device using the import feature.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you subscribe, your data will be saved in the cloud and you can bypass
    this whole process.

  <h2>
    CSV Uploads
  </h2>
  <p>
    If you have loads of data stored elsewhere, you can upload them via CSV
    rather than manually entering it on the site. Each upload requires certain
    formatting, but there are templates available to help with that process.
