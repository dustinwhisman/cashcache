      Managing your recurring expenses is a premium feature, but here's what
      you're missing.

    <ul class="stack" style="--stack-space: 0.75em">
      <li>
        Speed up the process of entering expenses that are the same every month
      </li>
      <li>
        Keep track of annual or 6-month expenses that you might otherwise forget
      </li>
      <li>
        Know how much money is already accounted for before the month has even
        started, so you can plan what to do with the rest
      </li>

    <p>
      Save time by adding your typical expenses here. At the beginning of each
      month, you can copy these into your tracked expenses, giving you a head start
      and a heads up for what's coming.
    </p>

    <p data-no-recurring-expenses hidden>
      You haven't set up any recurring expenses yet. Take a look at your typical
      expenses, such as utility bills and subscriptions, as well as less frequent
      but predictable expenses like insurance.
