      you're missing.

        Speed up the process of entering income that is the same every month, or
        two weeks, or whatever the case may be
      </li>
      <li>
        Know how much money you can expect to come in during the month so you
        don't overshoot with your expenses

    <p>
      Save time by adding your typical income here. At the beginning of each month,
      you can copy these into your tracked income, giving you an idea of what you're
      working with for the month ahead.
    </p>

    <p data-no-recurring-income hidden>
      You haven't set up any recurring income yet. Take a look at your typical
      income like your paycheck as well as any other money that you get on a
      predictable basis.
