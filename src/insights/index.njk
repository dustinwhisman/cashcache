    Insights are a premium feature, but here's a breakdown of what you're
    missing.
  </p>
  <ul class="stack" style="--stack-space: 0.75em">
    <li>
      A chart of your financial progress based on all of the data you've
      entered. It shows your total expenses and income by month, as well as how
      much money you could safely withdraw from your savings each month without
      depleting them.
    </li>
    <li>
      A measure of how long your savings would last if you suddenly had no
      income, based on your expenses.
    </li>
    <li>
      An estimate of how much money you will need to retire, as well as how long
      it will take to get there, based on your average expenses and your savings
      rate.
    </li>
    <li>
      A chart of your savings rate by month, including a rolling average. The
      higher the better and the sooner you'll be able to retire.
    </li>

    Here are the key takeaways from your entire backlog of data. Keep in mind that
    this is not financial advice, and assumptions factor heavily into the
    calculations that drive these estimates.

          This is your progress chart. It shows your expenses and income along with
          the amount that you could safely withdraw each month (assuming you spend no
          more than 4% of your total savings per year and your savings are invested).
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the safe withdrawal amount is consistently higher than expenses, you
          have "enough" and could consider retirement.

          Your savings rate is an indicator of how much money you saved compared
          to your total income. The closer you are to 100%, the better. If you
          have a negative percentage, that means you spent more than you earned.
        </p>
        <p>
          This chart breaks your savings rate down by month and shows a 12 month
          rolling average.
