      This is your net worth chart. It shows your total savings minus your total
      debt for every month of data that you have saved. Some scenarios to look
      out for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Negative net worth and almost no savings: the priority here should be to
        build up a small emergency fund, like $1,000 or one month of expenses,
        then focus on paying off debt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Negative net worth but lots of savings: it may be worth using some of
        your savings to pay off a chunk of your debt. Without the interest
        payments dragging you down, it will be easier to build up those savings
        later.
      </li>
      <li>
        Positive net worth with debt: in this case, it makes more sense to use
        savings to pay off debt. Once debt free, any extra cash can go back into
        savings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Positive net worth and no debt: this is the goal â€“ without debt dragging
        you down, you can focus on building your savings, which will grow with
        interest if they're invested well.
      </li>
    </ul>
