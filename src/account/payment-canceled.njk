  You did not finish setting up your payment information. You may continue to
  use the site as a free user, but you will not be able to access cloud data,
  and you won't be able to use premium features until you've completed a
  payment.

<p>
  You will be prompted to provide payment every time you log in, but otherwise,
  the site will work as it would for a free user.
