# A Better Way to Track Your Money

Instead of working with complicated spreadsheets or inflexible budgets, Cash
Cache is built around tracking your money as it comes in and goes out. By simply
paying attention to what you do with your money, you're better equipped to
handle your finances than most, and you don't have to deal with the hassle of
creating a budget every month that you'll inevitably break.

## The Process

Our approach to tracking money is very simple. When you spend money, track it.
When you earn money, track it. Once per month, track the balances of any savings
accounts or loans that you have. Over time, we use rolling averages and monthly
data to show trends and project when you can expect to retire based on your
savings and monthly expenses.

## Try for Free

If you want to kick the tires, you can make use of out basic tracking features
for free, no login or credit card required. Your data is stored on your device
until you create an account, so we won't see anything that you track unless you
decide to upgrade.

If you want more advanced features, such as insights or tracking recurring
expenses, you can create an account for $5/month or $50/year.
